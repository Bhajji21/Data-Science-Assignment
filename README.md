Data Science Assignment
Task 1: Date preprocessing and data exploration

1. Use Pandas to load both trainingSet.csv and testingSet.csv

2. Find the number of patterns in each class for both loaded data sets using Python.

3. Choose an attribute and generate a boxplot for the two classes in the training set.

4. Show one scatter plot, that one feature agst another feature. It is your choice to show which Two features you want to use. You need to to use the training set. Divide the original training set into a smaller training set and a validation set. In this task, you need to use 55% of total training data points as the validation set.

Task 2: Do a principal component analysis

1. Perform a PCA analysis on the original training data set().

2. Project the test set on the same PCA space produced by the original training dataset.

3. Plot two subplots in one for one for the training data in the PC and PC2 projection space and Label the data in the picture according to dash, the other one for the test data in the same PCA space and label the data in the picture according to its classes.
